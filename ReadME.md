Steps to build and/or run the software:

  

1. Install MinGW Compiler

2. Open the directory to the file

3. Optionally to compile the program yourself use `g++ Workout-Planner.cpp Plan.cpp Exercise.cpp -o Workout-Planner`

4. Run the program `.\Workout-Planner.exe`

## Future Work

  

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

  

- [ ] Use Inheritance and polymorphism to create multiple child classes of exercise that support other types of exercises that aren't just strength training 

- [ ] Add the ability to write into and load from a .csv file so that the plans can be stored for later use

- [ ] Additional testing and error handling
